      <p>We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember
      always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon
      evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of
      another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig
      deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that <b>we are not
      descended from fearful men</b> — not from men who feared to write, to speak,
      to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.

      Prosperity comes to the mob, and to low-minded men as well as to great
      ones; but it is the privilege of great men alone to send under the yoke
      the disasters and terrors of mortal life: whereas to be always
      prosperous, and to pass through life without a twinge of mental distress,
      is to remain ignorant of one half of nature.

        It all comes back. Perhaps it is difficult to see the value in having one's self back in that kind of mood, but I do see it; I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind's door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were. I have already lost touch with a couple of people I used to be; one of them, a seventeen-year-old, presents little threat, although it would be of some interest to me to know again what it feels like to sit on a river levee drinking vodka-and-orange-juice and listening to Les Paul and Mary Ford and their echoes sing "How High the Moon" on the car radio. (You see I still have the scenes, but I no longer perceive myself among those present, no longer could ever improvise the dialogue.) The other one, a twenty-three-year-old, bothers me more. She was always a good deal of trouble, and I suspect she will reappear when I least want to see her, skirts too long, shy to the point of aggravation, always the injured party, full of recriminations and little hurts and stories I do not want to hear again, at once saddening me and angering me with her vulnerability and ignorance, an apparition all the more insistent for being so long banished.

        It is a good idea, then, to keep in touch, and I suppose that keeping in touch is what notebooks are all about. And we are all on our own when it comes to keeping those lines open to ourselves: your notebook will never help me, nor mine you.”

      If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start.
      This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your
      mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean
      freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It
      could mean mockery -- isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are
      a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And,
      you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better
      than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the
      way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the
      gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to
      perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.

      It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the
      strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done better.
      The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is
      marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and
      comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great
      devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows
      in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he
      fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never
      be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.

      Now for the matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists have
      tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He
      had tremendous drive. One day about three or four years after I joined, I
      discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a
      genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode’s office and
      said, “How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?” He leaned
      back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and
      said, “You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you
      worked as hard as he did that many years.” I simply slunk out of the
      office!

      What Bode was saying was this: “Knowledge and productivity are like
      compound interest.” Given two people of approximately the same ability
      and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will
      more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you
      learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the
      more the opportunity – it is very much like compound interest. I don’t
      want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people
      with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day
      out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more
      productive over a lifetime. I took Bode’s remark to heart; I spent a good
      deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I
      found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don’t like to say it in
      front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to
      study.  You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want
      done. There’s no question about this.
