      <p>We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember
      always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon
      evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of
      another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig
      deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that <b>we are not
      descended from fearful men</b> — not from men who feared to write, to speak,
      to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.

      Prosperity comes to the mob, and to low-minded men as well as to great
      ones; but it is the privilege of great men alone to send under the yoke
      the disasters and terrors of mortal life: whereas to be always
      prosperous, and to pass through life without a twinge of mental distress,
      is to remain ignorant of one half of nature.

      If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start.
      This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your
      mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean
      freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It
      could mean mockery -- isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are
      a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And,
      you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better
      than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the
      way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the
      gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to
      perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.

      It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the
      strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done better.
      The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is
      marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and
      comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great
      devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows
      in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he
      fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never
      be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
