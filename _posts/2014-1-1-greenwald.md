I recently watched [Glenn Greenwald's keynote from this year's Chaos Computer
Club
conference](http://boingboing.net/2013/12/28/glenn-greenwalds-must-watch.html).
The whole speech is a darkly striking and inspiring look at the government's
role in compromising privacy, interplay with media outlets, and the heroes who
are making incredibly stressful trades to illuminate what's going on. If you
are even remotely intrigued by the Snowden situation or privacy in general,
it's worth a watch.

One theme Greenwald discussed resonated with me particularly strongly. He says
something that points to one fundamental distinction between governments and
corporations that I think is commonly overlooked. Greenwald spends a few
minutes (starting at around 24:00 in the link above) detailing the
sacrifices that certain whistleblowers have made:

> What [Laura Poitras] said to me is, "You know, it's amazing if you think
> about it." She went through the list of people who have devoted themselves to
> transparency and the price that they have paid. She said Edward Snowden is
> stuck in Russia facing thirty years in prison, Chelsea Manning is in prison,
> Aaron Swartz committed suicide. People like Jeremy Hammond and Barrett Brown
> are the subjects of grotesquely overzealous prosecutions by virtue of the
> acts of transparency they've engaged in. Even people like Jim Risen, who is
> with an organization like the New York Times, faces the possibility of prison
> for stories that he's published.
> 
> Laura and I have been advised by countless lawyers that it is not safe for us
> to even travel to our own country, and she said, "It's really a sign of how
> sick our political future has become, that the price for bringing
> transparency to the government, and for doing the job of the media, and the
> Congress, that they're not doing, is this extreme form of punishment."

Snowden in exile, Manning in prison, Swartz dead. All very real physical 
consequences that resulted from the non-violent process of trying to shed light
on actions taken with public money.

Compare these cases to the instance of [a security researcher hacking Facebook
to post on Zuckerberg's
wall](http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/18/security-researcher-hacks-mark-zuckerbergs-wall-to-prove-his-exploit-works/)
after being ignored by Facebook's support. This action was among the most
embarrassing public demonstrations of that vulnerability that he could have
chosen; you can bet it left Facebook's security team blushing. What was the
consequence to the researcher?

Was he threatened with jail time, legal battles, or exile? Did anyone knock on
his door with a rifle? Was he hunted down, forced to flee his home and family?
Will he have to look over his shoulder for the rest of his life in fear of
being captured or killed? 

No. He was denied the bug bounty that Facebook typically awards individuals who
report vulnerabilities.

What might the cost have been if he'd hacked NSA's system instead of 
Facebook's?


### What is the defining characteristic of government?

Most people don't seem to understand that the single characteristic that
differentiates governments from any other sort of entity is that governments
function as a monopoly on force. The government is the *only one that is
legally sanctioned to introduce a gun into the equation*. This enables
governments to collect taxes, impose regulations and laws, hold secret courts,
and imprison whistleblowers indefinitely.

To some degree, that's the whole point: we want the government to physically
prevent or discourage things like violent crimes from happening. The problem
comes when this unique power allows the government to expand its province into
criminalizing non-violent drug usage, listening to our phone calls, and
clandestinely tweaking the backbone of the internet.

Facebook and Google have never leveled anyone's door with assault rifles in tow
because someone revealed inconvenient details about criminal actions they may
have committed, nor have they the legal leeway to do so. 

They may collect and sell your data (with your voluntary consent), but they'll
never point a gun at you.  The primary risk of their data collection resulting
in physical harm to you is if a governmental agency comes calling to extort
that data under legal threat, and then incriminates you for whatever
flavor-of-the-week crime.

You can stop using Google. You can't opt into or
out of government surveillance. 

### Priorities for privacy activists

We have a significant problem with the way our government currently operates.
This malfunction dwarfs any threats that private organizations impose right
now.  While those private organizations may grow to be more problematic in
time, today's Goliath is the runaway government that is imprisoning non-violent
citizens to cover its own crimes.
