So, government is proposing a policy that claims to address an economic
injustice, but unfortunately

- it's poorly implemented (technically),

- it demonstrates an incredible lack of understanding in the underlying subject
  matter,

- it was introduced and is supported by a small number of people with a lot of
  money, and

- the burden of correction falls on a public who is almost entirely indifferent
  and also demonstrates an impressive lack of understanding in the underlying
  subject.

The internet at-large is up in arms about it. That's good, but to someone versed
in basic economics, this is just business as usual.

## Nothing new

After interstate tariffs coupled with price-ceilings caused a [gas shortage in
the '70s](http://www.naturalgas.org/regulation/history.asp#effects) that *killed
people* living in states not rich in natural energy and thus could not buy gas
to heat their homes, SOPA seems like a drop in the well.

After understanding that minimum wage actually [hurts the
poor](http://www.house.gov/jec/cost-gov/regs/minimum/against/against.htm) and
keeps [black teenagers in the
slums](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703859304576307201724065640.html#)[^1]
how can I be surprised, outraged, or even expect to care about SOPA?

The system is broken; libertarians have known this for a long time (some even
[understand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem)
[why](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter)). I'm glad
that SOPA is bringing the faults of this system to light, but after witnessing
the 12-course meal in stupidity-manifest-in-policy that was the twentieth
century, I'm pretty callous to the government enacting laws that have horrid
consequences for the public.

Until the internet starts talking about fixing the problem and not chasing a
symptom, I'll be coding.

[^1]: The education they receive from the state is clearly near-worthless, so how
else can they grow their income but on-the-job experience? Oops; it's not worth
it for an employer to hire an inner-city teenager because the market value of
his labor is below the artificial price floor. Guess they'll just sell drugs,
then. Oh wait; isn't that the result of another great policy?
