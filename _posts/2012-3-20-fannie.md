From [a Rolling Stone
article](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/bank-of-america-too-crooked-to-fail-20120314?print=true)
on how Bank of America manipulates government to steal from the public:

> Another public lifeline is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant, nationalized
> mortgage lenders. Need to make some cash? Toss a bunch of home loan
> applications onto a city street, then sell the resulting mortgages to Fannie

> second-rate managers.

> Just like the state pensions in Iowa and Maine and Mississippi, Fannie and

Were the government not in the business of securing mortgages and playing
favorites in the banking industry, this kind of manipulation and theft wouldn't
be possible. Corporations not [in bed with the
Treasury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae#Implicit_Guarantee_and_Government_Support)
don't buy securities they know to be worthless, because purely-private companies
are not insulated from irreparably stupid decisions with [the public's
money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).
