For many years I've had anxiety. Some years it's been crippling: hypochondria,
regular panic attacks; the full nine yards. I won't bore you with the details
beyond saying the bad years were very bad; anyone who's had a dance with panic
disorder can empathize.

Out of any experience that bad [inevitably comes some
good](https://jamesob.tumblr.com/post/93012819939/the-good-in-the-bad). One
of these merciful silver linings was that it drove me to learn how to meditate.
Somehow I'd come across [mindfulness-based stress
reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction), a
secular program developed by a doc (Jon Kabat-Zinn) and now used in many
hospitals. I've written about some of the studies that document its benefits
[before](https://jamesob.tumblr.com/post/93734983064/study-roundup-does-meditation-reduce-anxiety).

Meditation really isn't some woo-woo thing, at least for me. It's more or less
just quieting down for a short while and seeing what floats to the
top.  During this process of mental relaxation your body *physically* relaxes
in a very pleasant way. The sensation of discovering tension in your
musculature that you were previously unaware of, then feeling it recede is hard
to overstate. I feel my circulation open up - my hands and arms, often cold and
tight, become warm and comfortably heavy.

There are many analogues, especially for programmers, to meditation:

- it's like running [`top`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(software)) on
  your mind. It occurs to you what you're *really* thinking about, what's
  *really* important. A few times (and this is not the primary feature or
  purpose of meditation, far from it), I've started to meditate and then
  realized some very important task that I'd forgotten about up until then.

- it's like
  [defragging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Drive_Optimizer) your
  mind: it gives your subconscious a chance to chew through a backlog of
  thoughts and the accumulated cake of emotion that builds throughout the day.
  This queued processing otherwise would have to wait until the night's sleep
  to run. I suspect this is why meditating in the middle of the day helps me
  to recover some focus (when I actually do it).

- it's basically just a way of spending quality time with yourself. I know this
  sounds benign or almost meaningless, but the time that you actually get to
  spend in your own head without being harangued by podcasts, music, other
  people, visual stimulation, food, etc. is profoundly rare. When's the last time
  you were legitimately alone with yourself? 
  
  It's a wonderfully comforting thing to spend that kind of conscious time with
  your own mind - no matter what your physical circumstances, you can feel at
  home, at ease, safe. I can't tell if this sensation comes immediately, even
  on a first meditation, or if it's a learned response that results from the
  practice of meditation. In any case, it's one of my favorite parts.


To say that I meditate regularly these days would be an overstatement. I do it
sometimes, and I want to do it a whole lot more than I am. But when
I do make time for it, it's so worthwhile. Oftentimes when I finish a 15 or 20
minute meditation - nothing more than sitting and focusing on the movement of
my belly with each breath - I feel like I've just returned from a week of
vacation.

Some forms of meditation haven't worked well for me; my initial foray into this
kind of thing was after a coworker gave me a book that taught me a form of
meditation based on mentally reciting a mantra or prayer over and over. I tried
this pretty doggedly for a while but didn't get much out of it. I find this
MBSR approach simpler and a little more grounded, but of course mileage may
vary.

All told, it's one of the most rewarding skills I've picked up; if you have any
interest I'd encourage you to give it a shot. I've noticed that even when I'm
not meditating regularly, I have a kind of regular awareness throughout the day
of the tension in my body. I don't think this was a sense I had before I did
the MBSR routine for a few weeks.
