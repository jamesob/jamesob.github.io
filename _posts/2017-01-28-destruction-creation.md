I wonder if we'd have computers today if World War II hadn't been so
terrifically horrible. 

The death, destruction, and general frenzy that comes with an existential crisis
at the national level drive individuals to do remarkable things. Not hard to
imagine that's because survival and way of life are on the line. 

Code breaking and the development of nuclear weapons during WWII undoubtedly
pushed computing forward. Alan Turing, the father (or at the very least the guy
who delivered the baby) of modern computing, started work on [the theoretical
basis for the computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
back in 1936, before WWII, but he spent the war holed up in Bletchely Park,
putting into application much of the theory about computing that he'd been
developing beforehand:

> The British needed mathematicians to crack the German Navy’s Enigma code.
> Turing worked in the British top-secret Government Code and Cipher School at
> Bletchley Park. There code-breaking became an industrial process; 12,000
> people worked three shifts 24/7. Although the Polish had cracked Enigma before
> the war, the Nazis had made the Enigma machines more complicated; there were
> approximately 10^(114) possible permutations. Turing designed an
> electromechanical machine, called the Bombe, that searched through the
> permutations, and by the end of the war the British were able to read all
> daily German Naval Enigma traffic.

It's hard to argue that this sort of effort and rabid allocation of talent
wouldn't have moved "practical" computing forward by quite a lot. I'm sure there
are many analogues for math and physics on the nuclear side of the story.

For a page-turning and mostly fictional read that gets deep into some of this
stuff, see [Cryptonomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon).

## No free lunch?

Prepare yourself for a grim statistic: over 60 million people died in WW2.
That's an incomprehensible number of anything, let alone human beings. It would
be a deeply ironic thing if it took a toll on human life and happiness of that
magnitude to till the soil for a potentially wonderful thing like computing. 

I hope that isn't a case. I hope that the way to technological prosperity isn't
some near zero-sum trade with stupefyingly tragic wars at the other end of the
table.  I'd like to imagine that if WWII hadn't happened, some kind of peaceful
potpourri of telecommunication and profit motive would've eventually netted us
personal computers, but it's hard to know. 

It's safe to say the kind of abilities, value, and connectivity that we enjoy
because of widely dispersed computing wouldn't have gotten here nearly as
quickly, and that's ironic.
