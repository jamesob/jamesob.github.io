Starting in 2008, central banks injected an unprecedented amount of new money
into the global financial system. Along with big gaps in wealth
distribution, this has created profound systemic risk. The last few months have
shown indications that this risk is starting to come to the surface.

The setup in front of us is not for a garden variety recession. It's for
potential cataclysm: a drawdown that will hit normal investors hard, but
retirees and pensions especially so, threatening the premise of our financial
system. This crash, or even just the threat of it, will lead our governments to
take extraordinary action in an attempt to avert a long depression. That action
will cause an incredible level of inflation.

As I've watched the following events play out, some of the only optimism I feel
is due to the emergence of Bitcoin as a nascent asset class. I see
this new tool as one of the only potential safeguards that people in normal
income brackets have against the kind of trouble I'm forecasting. 

<div class='bitcoin-for'> <p> As I lay out the narrative I've watched unfold
over the past few years, I'll occasionally interject with observations
(formatted like this) on why I think Bitcoin is going to become increasingly
important, even relative to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. After
reading a draft of this post, my brother lovingly dubbed this "the shill zone," and
I don't disagree.  </p> <p> It should be obvious, but as an explicit
disclosure: I am long Bitcoin.  </p>

### Welcome to negative

It's an exceptional time in economics. Negative-yielding bonds have passed the
$16 trillion mark for the first time ever. Germany's flagship 30
year bond yield has gone negative, also for the first time in history. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;$16t in negative yielding debt &amp; rising not good for managers of long-term liabilities such as pensions &amp; insurers. AUM for all developed world pension funds stood at $27.5t in May 2019. In countries w/ negative yields, pension funds’ AUM totals $4.7t&quot; <a href="https://t.co/faE5Eiy6zb">https://t.co/faE5Eiy6zb</a> <a href="https://t.co/hXmbq8KkhP">pic.twitter.com/hXmbq8KkhP</a></p>&mdash; Trevor Noren (@trevornoren) <a href="https://twitter.com/trevornoren/status/1165156281646243840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This means that investors are paying governments (and some companies) for the
privilege of lending them money. I pay the German government $10,000 today and
in thirty years I get back $11 less. Intuitively this doesn't make much sense:
given the time-value of money, cash I have on hand now should be worth more
than theoretical cash in 30 years, at the very least because I may not be
around in 30 years to spend it.

And besides, there's what we call "counterparty risk:" the possibility that the
German government might not repay me (admittedly a low likelihood) or the
possibility that the euro will have suffered significant inflation since then,
reducing the real purchasing power of my $10,000 (a much higher likelihood).
The risks of lending money for 30 years should be offset by some reward, but
with negative yields the lender is penalized for assuming this risk.

This may not seem like such a big deal, or at most a weird abstraction more or
less confined to finance people, the kind of people who worry
about bond yields and think in basis points. 

If only.

Negative yields dramatically affect, for example, retirees because
traditionally retirees have held a lot of money in "fixed income," or bonds. The
deal was that you spent your prime years earning, saving, and maybe investing
in risky assets (equities) and as you got closer to retirement age, you
[flipped most of your
allocation](https://www.thebalance.com/new-investing-bonds-rule-4129178) to
less risky investments that yield a consistent return - i.e. bonds.  This
ensured that your hard-earned savings wouldn't evaporate in an equities
downturn.

Since negative rates eat at savings instead of paying out, retirees---and
pension funds, but we'll talk about those later---are driven towards keeping
their money in risk, or equities and lower quality credit, and basically having their
savings exposed to the stock market and all its associated drama:


> These low rates have been great for borrowers including countries, companies
> and mortgage holders, since the cost of servicing debt has dropped. On the

> **The bottom line is that no one really knows how this will end up since we’ve never seen it before.**

Negative rates are strange and disconcerting in themselves, but reconstructing
their cause reveals other big problems as we'll see in a bit.
 

<div class='bitcoin-for'><p><b>This is what Bitcoin is for.</b>
Bitcoin, like gold, is a "non-productive" asset, a commodity. This means that
it doesn't in itself generate yield, though obviously there's been plenty of
price appreciation over its ten year life.</p>

<p>For reasons I'll describe shortly, this new asset is a possible tool for
countering increasingly negative yields and diversifying savings. A 1 to 5%
allocation lets you simultaneously cordon off risk to a small percentage of
your portfolio but retain exposure to considerable upside.  It's the <a

barbell doctrine</a> incarnate.

</blockquote>

Instead of risking a huge portion of your savings in equities for positive
return, you can use a small amount of Bitcoin as a metaphorical call option on
a new asset class &ndash; an asset class that isn't affected by the same
vulnerabilities that have created the negative rate conundrum, in addition to
the other maladies we'll get around to later.  </p>

### How did we get here?

So this $16T pile of negatively-yielding debt is something that's never
happened before, and based on common sense it seems kind of unnatural. How did
it happen?

For the past 30 years, governments and specifically central banks have been a
lot more active in monetary intervention (i.e. influencing the money supply) in
an attempt to be *counter-cyclical*. This means that governments basically want
to smooth out the booms and busts that the business cycle is naturally subject
to. 

![business cycle](/images/fin-buscycle.png)

<div class="caption">
<a href='https://gohighbrow.com/fluctuations-in-the-business-cycle/'>Source</a>
</div>

When a recession or depression happens, the central bank steps in and "provides
liquidity," meaning they inject cash into the banking system by doing things
like buying US debt instruments from certain banks at above-market price. This
gives the banks extra cash on their balance sheets to lend out, and so lowers
the interest rates on pretty much everything else. This introduces unnaturally
cheap credit that is supposed to stoke the economy by encouraging people to buy
more things and take out more loans.

When the economy is running too hot, the Fed (the US central bank) raises the price of money and
limits credit expansion, though they haven't done much of this
in the past 20 years. As we'll see, the economy
has become reliant on cheap credit in deep and interesting ways.

 
<img width='100%' src='/images/fin-2018.png' />

<div class="caption"> In 2018, the market crashed 11%, the worst December since

"dovish pivot" back to rate cuts in 2019.<br />The economy will no longer
tolerate rising interest rates.</div>
 

### Post 2008

Central bank intervention came to a fever pitch 11 years ago. The 2007/8
financial crisis was so bad that the Fed went beyond its usual measures. It
drastically upped its purchase of US Treasuries (debt) and started buying
things like mortgage-backed securities.

The chart below shows the level of our monetary base, or the amount of currency
circulating plus the level of reserves banks hold at the Fed. This is one of my
favorite charts of all time, it's just insane.

<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=lIdk&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true"></iframe></div><script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<div class="caption">Over $3.3 trillion <b>(5x)</b> in new money was created starting in 2008.<br />Shaded gray bars are periods of recession.</div>

The tricky part about central bank intervention is that it's a discretionary
process driven by a relatively small group of people. How much intervention is
too much? In 2008, the answer seemed to be "almost no amount is too much."

As you can see above, this resulted in the supply of base money roughly
*quintupling*. Why we didn't see crippling inflation is another story for a
different blog[^1]. Even though we didn't see traditional (and I would argue
deceptive) measures of inflation like CPI and PCE spike, all this extra
"liquidity" has led to systemic bubbles in important asset
markets like real estate

<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=oH3c&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true"></iframe></div><script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
                             
<div class="caption">

<div class="caption">

</div>

So now the housing market is more overbought than before the crash in 2007 and
the stock market is... well, almost two and a half times more overbought than
ever.

The root of this being that well-intended central banks are trying to
protect us from the volatility that comes with the natural ebbs and flows of
the business cycle.[^2]


Our friends in Europe have basically gone through the same process, except
instead of attempting to "normalize" and tighten credit in the last few years,
they've had to double down on easing in order to stave off collapse, probably
due to intra-EU debt problems.

<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=m5b4&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true"></iframe></div><script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

This is what has created deeply negative bond rates in Europe - the European
Central Bank (ECB) has been aggressively purchasing bonds in an attempt to
inject cash into the economy, which drives bond yields down and in the process
hurts anyone relying on fixed income.


<div class='bitcoin-for'><p><b>This is what Bitcoin is for.</b> 
Bitcoin's monetary supply can't be expanded by anyone, let alone a small
committee of economists. There will only ever be 21 million coins minted.

<p>
Because Bitcoin's monetary base cannot be increased, once you have a certain
fraction of Bitcoin's total supply you will <i>always have at least
that fraction.</i> It is literally the only asset ever to have this property,
and this fact alone makes Bitcoin extremely unique. 
As a result, some people refer to Bitcoin as "the metric

</p>
</div>


### Hair of the dog

Injecting trillions of dollars into the money supply isn't something we can
easily walk back from, since the resulting availability of credit has allowed
our economy to stave off slowdowns by increasing "leverage," or using debt to 
fund expansion.
 
<img width='100%' src='/images/fin-corpdebt.png' />

<div class="caption">

</div>
                                                
One way this cheap credit is used is for leveraged share buybacks, a term
you've probably heard recently. In a nutshell, this is when a company takes
advantage of favorably low interest rates (enabled by the central bank's
intervention) to take out a loan. Using the loan, the company buys back its own
shares which (definitionally) reduces the number of shares outstanding and
artificially boosts earnings-per-share, sending share prices higher. This has
the genial side effect of making executive-owned stock options way more 
valuable. 

<img width='100%' src='/images/fin-buybacks.png' />

<div class="caption">
Buybacks are more frequent than ever and are increasingly responsible for price
appreciation. <a
href="https://grizzle.com/share-buybacks-corporations/">Source</a>
</div>
    
When people talk about "the financialization" of the economy, this is one of
the chief symptoms they're talking about. Activity in the real economy is
replaced with accounting semantics.

It turns out that share buybacks are now the dominant source of demand for
equities. This is very interesting.

![buybacks](/images/fin-buybacks2.png)

<div class="caption">
Data from <a
href="https://heisenbergreport.com/2019/06/11/that-us-corporate-cash-pile-is-being-spent-so-what-about-the-buybacks/">Goldman Sachs</a>
</div>

It's interesting because it creates an important dependence on cheap credit in
the economy:

- investors, retirees, pension funds[^3] have been driven out of "safe" bonds and
  into equities and riskier credit (corporate bonds) in a search for returns,
  so there is a systemic dependence on the stock market going up or at the very
  least retaining its value
- but the dominant buyer of equities are companies themselves (see table
  above), funded by cheap credit,
- so share prices are largely contingent on credit remaining cheap...


### A quick note on pensions

Public pensions in America probably merit their own post because they're so
horrifying, but the short version is that their prospects for solvency are not
good. Even assuming a starry-eyed rate of return (7.5% per year), they're still
underfunded by $2 trillion. 

 
<img width='100%' src='/images/fin-pensions.png' />
<div class='caption'><a href='https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-pension-hole-for-u-s-cities-and-states-is-the-size-of-japans-economy-1532972501'>Source</a>
</div>
 

There's no risk-free way to get 7.5%. In order to get returns like that, you
have to expose yourself to the equities market or, as is commonly the case
these days, low-grade corporate debt. Under normal circumstances, seeing price
volatility and riding out periods of loss is a guarantee for the
kind of assets that net you 7.5% per annum.

If we assume that pensions get a more realistic rate of return, the unfunded
liabilities rise to as much as $8 trillion.

<img width='100%' src='/images/fin-pension.png' />
<div class='caption'>Did I mention that public pensions are still
underfunded by $2T+ assuming a 7.5% yearly return?
</div>

Keep in mind, this 7.5% of return is expected in a world where most government
debt is now *negatively yielding.*

In the desperate search for return, pensions are increasingly relying on large
positions of risky allocations. For example, the [New York State Teacher's
Retirement
System](https://www.nystrs.org/NYSTRS/media/PDF/About%20Us/fixed_domestic.pdf)
owns $35 million of BBB-rated General Electric bonds. If the [GE fraud
story](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/business/dealbook/ge-fraud.html) has
any merit, those bonds may be downgraded to BB which would compel *all pension
funds nationally* to unload the bonds. The funds would sell at a sizable loss
and probably crash the corporate bond market.

Because of this chase for yield, the stability of our pension system is now
predicated on the stock and corporate bond markets forever performing. There is
not good historical precedent for this.
          
<div class='bitcoin-for'><p><b>This is what Bitcoin is for.</b> Pensions could
juice their returns for far less risk by selling off their large allocation of
garbage BBB corporate bonds, almost certain to implode or suffer downgrades in
a recession, and placing their risk in a much smaller percentage allocation of
Bitcoin.  </p> </div>

If pensions are reliant on risky assets for solvency, this means they are now
reliant on cheap credit for solvency.
         
### The huge problem starts when and if

- credit *doesn't* get cheaper: slowing and heavily indebted companies like
  GE and AT&T won't be able to keep buying back and their share prices will
  fall significantly,
- this puts a drag on the stock market and potentially creates downgrades in
  corporate credit, a disasterous outcome because
- by law, pension funds are now forced to sell masses of recently-downgraded
  corporate bonds since they are no longer investment grade (IG), sending
  corporate yields skyrocketing,
- which further drives the stock market lower as companies become unable to pay
  their debt by taking out new loans,
- which further batters pension funds and investors.

As you can imagine, this could get really, really bad. Really bad.
 
Imagine you're a retiree who's been forced into the equities market because
you started saving late or you otherwise can't afford low rates of safe credit.
You put 80% of your money into equities. Then one day the process above
triggers and your wealth halves as the market crashes. This applies equally to
pensions.
         
<div class='bitcoin-for'><p><b>This is what Bitcoin is for.</b> 

My guess is that Bitcoin will not be hit nearly as hard as the equity market
will, assuming its price  doesn't <i>appreciate</i> in a scenario like this &mdash; a scenario
I'd argue Bitcoin was designed for &mdash; if it functions as a
safe-haven asset. This is because institutional ownership of Bitcoin is almost
nonexistent at the moment. In a rush for the exit (liquidity), large
institutions will be selling off risk assets, but I don't think these
institutions have any substantial volume of BTC to sell.
</p>
<p>
The kind of ownership that would be compelled to sell in a situation like this,
"weak hands," have already
been shaken out of their positions by BTC's volatility. The remaining owners are
in it for the longterm. It's my guess that in a
downturn, BTC's relative price will be neutral to positive.
</p>

</div>
         
The equities market, having been stoked up on easy credit (now painfully dry)
may well see a 60-70% decline. Returning to current levels won't be in the
cards for years, maybe decades. We're talking about a depression and a bunch
of people who are no longer able to fund their retirement. It'd be bad.

### QE forever

So anyway the above is all theoretical, because there won't be a crash... not
in the form we're used to, anyway.
The government basically can't let this happen. They have to keep the
liquidity (read: cheap credit) flowing or else we have, basically, a complete
collapse in equities and low-quality debt, and therefore in public pensions
(who own large amounts of these things). This starts to get to, like,
civilizational severity.

Central banks will have to keep creating money to keep credit cheap so that
companies can continue to buy back their own shares and prop up the equity
market. This will continue to increase the money supply and will further
exacerbate bubbles in real estate and equities. These bubbles will steadily
widen the divide between the have-assets and the have-no-assets in America.

The sort of recession that most people expect eventually may never come, since
it can't be allowed to come. We may have entered a new monetary regime after
the fireworks in 2008.

<div class='bitcoin-for'><p><b>This is what Bitcoin is for.</b> 

Central banks will continue easing until there is nothing left of their
currencies; I can't really see an alternative. There's no soft landing out of
this credit-fueled asset bubble. There's no clean way to deleverage the pile of
debt corporates have taken on.</p>

<p> Historically gold has been a safe haven refuge in times of contraction and
inflation, and I own some small amount, but I'm no great fan. Gold is
impractical: it's hard to verify, hard to custody, isn't easily divisible, and
just feels kind of outdated. The only easy way to buy exposure to gold (ETFs)
are still just a paper proxy for the real thing.  They're subject to the same
kind of risks if there's a huge crash and financial markets are ordered to a
halt. Bitcoin maintains liquidity through such a crash because governments
can't stop its ability to perform transactions.  </p>

<p>
Unlike gold, the authenticity of a Bitcoin balance is immediately verifiable with
off-the-shelf consumer electronics, and anyone can safely custody it themselves
regardless of amount.
</p>

<p> It can't be confiscated. It's perpetually and internationally liquid. It
doesn't know borders and gives final settlement in hours. It makes capital
flight trivial and open to people who aren't fabulously rich or well-connected.
Nobody's sure yet, but for these reasons I think there's a decent chance
that Bitcoin will function as a safe-haven asset, much like gold, in a
significant downturn.  </p>

### The macro picture

So far we've mostly just been talking about troubles in the US domestic
economy. Things get really spicy when we start talking about the increasing
international disgruntlement with the US dollar.

Since the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, the US dollar has had the
"exorbitant privilege" of being the reserve currency of the world. This has
meant that there's always a healthy demand for the dollar, which in turn stokes
reliable demand for our government debt in the form of Treasuries (well, until
recently). This has let us run big deficits without worrying too much:
there will always going to be other countries waiting in line to roll our
debt by buying Treasuries, right? They want to buy oil, don't they?

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this will last. Foreign banks have stopped
buying US treasuries at an alarming rate.

<img width='100%' src='/images/fin-treasholdings.jpg' />
<div class='caption'>Foreign central banks' holdings of US Treasuries down

US sovereign debt doesn't even have a yield advantage anymore even though
treasury yields are nominally positive.  It turns out that once foreign
investors hedge for currency risk, US bond yields go even more negative than
their European counterparts mentioned early in the article.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And today: Absurdity that the US w/ at least $800bn net in Treasuries to still be auctioned this year has the least attractive (most inverted) G10 curve and missing foreign end buyers that have been &quot;priced out of the market&quot; <a href="https://t.co/Lpkjimi9Nr">pic.twitter.com/Lpkjimi9Nr</a></p>&mdash; Andrew W.

Foreign central banks may not be buying our treasuries, but they're sure

The writing's on the wall. The rest of the world is getting tired of funding
another country's obviously-unsustainable programs like social security and

Budget deficits continue to grow at record levels ([$234 billion for the month

the US has set itself up for. Even if the USD is a convenient tool for most
countries now, the numbers are unworkable: the US is at some point going to
have no choice but to print its way out of a massive debt.

The coming years will continue to see lackluster Treasury demand, 
hoarding of gold by central banks, and more calls to [replace the dollar with

palatable on both ends: politicians love spending money without having to tax,
and constituents love free stuff. You will continue to see MMT in the form of a
Green New Deal or some kind of Republican-friendly equivalent, probably
relating to infrastructure, and deficits will launch into the stratosphere.

Our ability to get funding from the rest of the world will wane concordantly,
and some combination of the Fed, the Treasury, and more loose fiscal policy
will coalesce to manufacture remarkable amounts of new money. The resulting
inflation will be historic.

anyone who wants it.  </p>

<p>
Yes, central banks are buying gold and will likely continue to do so. Maybe
some even have the intent of reforming the monetary system to sit on top of
some kind of gold standard 2.0. Rumors circulate that China is working on
a gold-backed cryptocurrency.
</p>

<p>
The reality is that we can never credibly return to a gold standard.
Repatriating gold to do final settlement is incredibly costly and <a href='https://www.newsweek.com/plane-carrying-9-tons-gold-and-silver-blocks-loses-cargo-during-takeoff-846738'>error
prone</a>.
Even setting aside practical difficulties, gold (or anything gold-backed, whether it's digital or
not) will always come with counterparty risk. When Nixon ended the
redeemability of dollars for gold in 1971, the die was cast. You can only
stain that shirt once. Is China any less likely than 1970s US to suspend gold 
convertibility when the going gets tough? 
</p>

<p>

Bitcoin is fully digital bearer asset and as such it has no counterparty risk.
Final settlement occurs indisputably within hours, not weeks. The cost of
storing it is negligible. Cryptographic features like multisignature schemes
and scripting abilities like timelocks enable a trustless programmability that
makes it a completely new kind of financial asset, which is basically just a
bonus on top of its killer feature: <b>hardness as a money and suitability as a
safe-haven asset.</b>

### It only gets crazier from here

I'm not sure that Bitcoin will work in the way that I think it will. Nobody is.
But I *am* sure that if the narrative I spell out above is anywhere near right,
the financial system in its current form is in for an abrupt change
in the next few years. I *am* sure that there's no coming back from the
government largesse that materialized in 2008, both in terms of the
reliance on credit it introduced and the precedent for significant
intervention that it set.

The kind of central bank interventions we've seen in the past 11 years are
without equal. Regardless of political affiliation, most people who've been
watching finance acknowledge we're in uncharted territory. The [average life of
a fiat currency is 27
years](https://www.dinardirham.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-fiat-currencies/), and
since going off the gold standard (which I'm not necessarily defending), the US
government has been allowed to engage in an inflationary frenzy that has no sign of
slowing down.

Bitcoin is designed, intentionally or incidentally, as a near ideal tool to
have access to when this level of turmoil hits global markets, when governments
start to engage in never-before-seen monetary experimentation, when Treasury
departments and other political institutions start to lose their credibility.
Trustless settlement makes Bitcoin the ideal ["currency of
enemies"](https://twitter.com/murchandamus/status/926928242933510144) and
censorship resistance means unconditional liquidity.

This doesn't mean that Bitcoin will actualize on its potential in whatever next
crisis lies ahead of us, but it would seem foolish not to have a small amount
of your portfolio betting that it will, whether you're a pension desperate for
yield or a millennial like me, disenchanted with almost every other option.

[^1]: Why didn't all this money result in rampant inflation? Because the Fed started paying interest on excess reserves (IOER), depository institutions hold a lot of this new money in reserves at the Fed and get paid an unnaturally high interest rate to do so.

[^2]: This should be immediately and obviously sisyphean but hey nobody's perfect.
[^3]: American public pension funds are [underfunded by anywhere from $2T-$8T](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-09/public-pension-ponzi-are-public-pensions-short-8-trillion) depending on who you ask.
