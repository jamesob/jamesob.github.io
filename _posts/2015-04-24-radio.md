One of the things that stuck with me from Donald Fagen's *Eminent Hipsters* is
how much radio shaped him growing up. Early in his teens he'd stay up late into
the night listening to jockeys in New York selecting
jazz tunes, their transmitted taste uninterrupted for hours.

These days, the closest thing (as far as I can tell) that we have to
interesting, contemporary musical radio shows are the mixes that we find on
SoundCloud -- but often these are hyper-specialized ("so-and-so plays great
east-German minimal house"). There are examples of [people who still capture
great variety in their sets](https://soundcloud.com/stephenhodgen), but they're
few and far between.  And no one that I've come across does it in the format of
a radio program.

I've been recording house mixes for a little while now, but ever since I 
read the Fagen book, I'd had the bug to try out this radio format. I love 
playing house tunes, but, as my friend, fellow sometimes-DJ Kevin Christensen
will tell you, the genre can start to feel like it's boxing you in.

This Saturday I finally got a decent mic set up and [recorded the first episode
of NITE SCHOOL](http://niteschool.co), a radio-style program that's recorded
live and captures a wider breadth of the kind of music I'm into. It's my
idealized soundtrack to solitary late nights. I'm going to try to keep up with
a strict per-week release.

Hope you enjoy, and drop a line if you're diggin it.
